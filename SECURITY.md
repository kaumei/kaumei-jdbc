# Security policy

**Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** takes security issues seriously.

---

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

If you believe you have found a security-related problem, contact the maintainer privately.
Please use GitHub Security Advisories: https://github.com/kaumei/kaumei-jdbc/security/advisories/new

Provide, if possible:
- a clear description of the issue
- affected versions
- steps to reproduce
- potential impact

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- **Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** code
- build and release artefacts
- published documentation

It does not cover:

- third-party libraries
- database products
- user applications

---

## Response

Security reports are handled on a best-effort basis.

If a vulnerability is confirmed, the maintainer will decide on:

- severity
- disclosure timeline
- fix and release strategy

---

The goal of this policy is responsible handling, not formal certification.
