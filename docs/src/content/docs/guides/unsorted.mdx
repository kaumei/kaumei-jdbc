import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { extractCodePart } from '../utils.ts';

The search order for converter etc. is always the same:

* method
* interface
* package
* config
* default values from **Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** (hard coded)


## Error handling

* if annotations show up at places we do not assume: we ignore them by JdbcNoRows
* if annotations show up we assume and have errors: we will throw an UnsupportedOperation exceptions


## Interface method annotations
The following annotation are only processed at interfaces methods, which are not default.
* `@JdbcNative` (type)
* `@JdbcSelect` (type)
* `@JdbcUpdate` (type)


## Type/Method annotations
To define common converter we support two annotations. 

* `@JdbcToJava` (type, method)
* `@JavaToJdbc` (type, method)

You can place the annotation at static methods which have the visibility public or package.
You can move the annotation to the type, in this case all valid methods will be tread as converter.

## Change default behavior
* `@JdbcConstructorAnnotations` (type)

Currently not used:
* `@JdbcConfig`
* `@JdbcNameMapping`
