---
import SpecTest from '../../../components/SpecTest.astro';

Converter are discovered/searched in the following order:
1) in the scope of the local interface (static methods annotated with `@JavaToJdbc` or `@JdbcToJava`)
   The interface may be annotated with easer `@JavaToJdbc` or `@JdbcToJava` (not both).
   In this case all static method which fit the converter definition will be taken in account.
2) in the global scope, defined with in the `@JdbcConfig` or with `@JdbcConfig(converter={})`.
   In the configuration you can define global reusable converter collections.
3) in the type which is used
   3.1) methods annotated with `@JavaToJdbc` or `@JdbcToJava`
   3.2) default converter for Java record or enum
4) Basic JDBC Types
