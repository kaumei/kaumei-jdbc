## Prerequisites
**Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** currently requires JDK 25.
Make sure your build and IDE use that runtime, as other Java versions are unsupported at the moment.

## Maven
Add **Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** dependencies to your `pom.xml`, either directly or inside dependency management.
* The `io.kaumei.jdbc:jdbc-annotation` contains only code that is needed during compile time,
  therefore its scope is `provided`. There is no need to include this in another scope.
* The `io.kaumei.jdbc:jdbc-core` contains boilerplate that is used by the generated code,
  therefore we keep it in the default `compile` scope.

<Code code={extractCodePart(pomCode, "dependency")} lang="xml" title="pom.xml"/>

Enable annotation processing by configuring the compiler plugin.
Currently, there are no known issues with the order in which the plugin is defined so far.
If you encounter any issues, please let us know.

<Code code={extractCodePart(pomCode, "compiler")} lang="xml" title="pom.xml"/>

<Aside>
Use the same version for `jdbc-annotation`, `jdbc-core`, and `jdbc-processor`. 
Mixing versions is not supported.
</Aside>

## IntelliJ
When you import the Maven project in IntelliJ IDEA, ensure annotation processing is enabled.
Open `Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors`.
Tick *Enable annotation processing*.
