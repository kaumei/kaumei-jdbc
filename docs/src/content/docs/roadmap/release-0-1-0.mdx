## Overview

**Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** 0.1.0 is our first public preview.
It focuses on proving that annotation processing can generate practical JDBC code
without hiding SQL or leaning on reflection.
Expect APIs to change before 1.0.0, but the core experience is ready for early
adopters.

## Highlights

* **code generation**:
  Annotated interfaces automatically gain JDBC implementations with compile-time
  binding validation.
* **SQL-first workflow**:
  `@JdbcSelect`, `@JdbcUpdate`, `@JdbcBatch`, and `@JdbcNative` keep SQL inline so
  reviews always see the queries being executed.
* **Type-safe mapping**:
  Map records, enums, and records, and register converters with `@JdbcToJava` or
  `@JavaToJdbc` for bidirectional conversions.
* **Batch execution**:
  Run batch updates with static or dynamic sizes while the generated code manages
  parameter binding and resource cleanup.
* **Generated values**:
  Capture keys or columns from single-row updates directly into Java types.
* **Modern collections**:
  Return `List`, `Stream`, or scalar values from  methods.
* **Integration hooks**:
  Runtime code only needs a `JdbcConnectionProvider`, making it easy to wire into
  Spring, Micronaut, Quarkus, or plain Java apps.

## Installation

Artifacts perform as `0.1.0` on Maven Central.
Follow the <Link ref="/intro/installation">installation guide</Link> to add
`jdbc-annotation`, `jdbc-core`, and `jdbc-processor` with the same version and to
enable annotation processing in your build.

## Known limitations
* IntelliJ occasionally drops annotation-processing classpath entries.
  If generated code is missing in the IDE, run `mvn compile` to confirm the
  build works; we are working on this.
* Loading SQL from the classpath via prefixes such as `include:` or `classpath:`.
* Calling stored procedures.
* Error messages can be improved.

## Road to 1.0.0

The road to 1.0.0 will be driven if there are 
During the 0.x series we will:

* check, if developers like this tool
* Stabilize the annotation processor output and contract tests.
* Fill the remaining converter and integration gaps.
* Improve diagnostics when code generation fails.

If there is little interest or feedback, the project may simply stay as it is.
