# **Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC**

**Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** aims to give teams the control of hand-written SQL with improved safety,
ergonomics, and observability compared to heavier frameworks.
It keeps SQL front and center while compiling the boring JDBC plumbing for you.
The docs for the latest release live at https://kaumei-jdbc.kaumei.io.

The project is under active development — APIs may change, and feedback is welcome.
Initial targets:
* SQL `SELECT` and `UPDATE` support
* Mapping Java objects and records
* Returning Java `List`, `Stream`, and scalar values
* Mapping between SQL and Java types in both directions
* Support for batch processing
* Support to retrieve generated values back from SQL into Java

Out of scope for now (native SQL is the workaround):
* Calling SQL procedures
* Loading SQL statements from the classpath
* JPA annotations
* Executing SQL scripts
* A lightweight **Kaumei&nbsp;TX** transaction helper
* Targeting multiple databases from the same codebase

## Why **Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC**
* **Compile-time checks**: Annotation processing generates DAO implementations
  and validates bindings up front.
* **No reflection in generated code**: Generated code is plain Java, so debuggers and
  profilers show real call stacks.
* **Explicit SQL, reusable mappers**: SQL stays in your codebase, converters are
  shared via annotations, and nothing is recreated at runtime.
* **Designed to be portable**: Can be used alongside most JDBC drivers and common DI/containers
  that can wire interfaces.

fit assessment, trade-offs, and integration notes.

## Requirements
**Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** targets currently JDK 25.
Earlier or later Java releases are not supported at the moment.

## Stability
All releases before 1.0.0 may include breaking API changes.
