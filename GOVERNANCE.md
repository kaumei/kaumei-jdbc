# Project Governance

This document describes how **Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** is run and how decisions are made.

---

## Project model

**Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** is a **maintainer-driven open source project**.

The maintainer is responsible for:
* the technical direction
* architectural decisions
* accepting or rejecting contributions
* moderation and project management

The primary goal is long-term technical quality and maintainability.

---

## Decision making
* Input and discussion are welcome.  
* Final decisions are made by the maintainer.
* There is currently no formal consensus, voting or community governance process.
* Discussions are used to explore ideas and technical arguments, not to determine outcomes.

---

## Contributions

Anyone may propose changes or submit pull requests.

The maintainer decides if and how contributions are integrated, based on:

* technical quality
* project scope and goals
* long-term maintenance impact

There is no obligation to accept contributions.

---

## Maintainers

* At this time, the project has a single maintainer.
* Additional maintainers may be invited in the future if the project grows and
  if there is a strong alignment in technical goals and working style.
* There is no automatic process for becoming a maintainer.

---

## Forks
* Forks are a normal and respected part of open source.
* This document describes how the **Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** project itself is run.  
* Other projects are free to adopt different governance models.

---

The intent of this governance model is to keep **Kaumei&nbsp;JDBC** focused, stable and sustainable.
